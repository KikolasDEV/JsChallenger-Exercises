/*
    Logical operators - logical OR
    Another way to chain multiple comparison operators is the logical OR (||) operator. 
    In the code below, result will have the value true if either of the comparison expressions evaluate to true.
    Adjust the code below such that result will have the value true.
    
    const numOne = 5;
    const numTwo = 5; 
    const result = numOne > 12 || numTwo > 12;
    console.log(result);

const numOne = 5;
const numTwo = 13; 
const result = numOne > 12 || numTwo > 12;
console.log(result);
