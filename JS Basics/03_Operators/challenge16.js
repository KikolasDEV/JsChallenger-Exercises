/*
    Arithmetic operators - Remainder
    In the code below we use the Remainder (%) operator to calculate the remainder of numOne divided by numTwo.
    The console.log() statement expects the remainder to be 3.
    Change the code so that the remainder is 3.
    
    const numOne = 13;
    const numTwo = 4;
    const remainder = numOne%numTwo;
    console.log(remainder === 3);
*/

const numOne = 13;
const numTwo = 5;
const remainder = numOne%numTwo;
console.log(remainder === 3);
