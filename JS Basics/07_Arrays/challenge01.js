/*
    Create a JavaScript array
    In this exercise, we have an array called arr. In the console.log() statement we use the array.length property to get the number of array elements. 
    The statement logs true if the array has 3 elements.
    Task: Add a third element to the array. It can have any value.
    
    const arr = ['a', 'b'];
    console.log(arr.length === 3);
*/

const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
console.log(arr.length === 3);
