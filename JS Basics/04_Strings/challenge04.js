/*
    Different ways to create Javascript strings
    Here, we have declared 3 variables textOne, textTwo, and textThree. An empty string is assigned to all of them.
    Do you see how in each case different symbols are used to create the string? All three of them are valid methods to create a JavaScript string.
    Fill in all 3 strings with some characters and run the code to see if the values get logged.
    
    const textOne = '';
    const textTwo = "";
    const textThree = ``;
    console.log(textOne, textTwo, textThree);
*/

const textOne = 'hello';
const textTwo = "how are u?";
const textThree = `Im fine`;
console.log(textOne, textTwo, textThree);
