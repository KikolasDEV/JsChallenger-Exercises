/*
    Is the String Longer Than 5?
    Given a string, assign the variable isLongerThanFive to true if its length is greater than 5, otherwise assign it to false.
    Tip: You can use the .length property to get the string’s length and the greater-than operator (>) to compare it.
    
    const str = "hello world";
    
    const isLongerThanFive = 
    
    console.log(isLongerThanFive);

const str = "hello world";
 
const isLongerThanFive = str.length > 5;
 
console.log(isLongerThanFive);
