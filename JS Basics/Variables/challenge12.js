/*
    Time to comment

    In this challenge, the variable x is reassigned to a new value, but we want to prevent this change.

    To do this, you can use a comment to "disable" the line of code that reassigns x. Comments can be used to stop specific code from running without deleting it.

    Your task:
    Comment out the reassignment of x so that the code still prints the value 100.

    let x = 100;
    // comment out the following line
    x = 0;
    console.log(x); // expected output: 100
*/

let x = 100;
// comment out the following line
// x = 0;
console.log(x); // expected output: 100
